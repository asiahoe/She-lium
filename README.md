# I.T.: IntraTerrestrial
## A Game By Team SHE-LIUM

A game created at the 2013 Code Liberation Game Jam.

You are an intra-terrestrial being who wants to explore the world outside. Using your balloon, escape the center of the earth! Beware of the sharp rocks in the earth's core!

### We are Team SHE-LIUM:
* Rebekka Dunlap (Art)
* Stephanie Hugh (Code)
* [Asia Hoe](https://github.com/asiahoe) (Code)
* [Arielle Martinez](https://github.com/relwordd) (Code)
* [Phaedra Riley](https://github.com/buhny) (Code)
* Seori Sachs (Music & SFX)

### Our Process:

We designed this game in less than 48 hours in [OpenFrameworks](http://openframeworks.cc/), a C++ toolkit for creative coding. With some instruction from [Code Liberation](https://github.com/CodeLiberation), and limited prior knowledge of programming and game design, we embarked on making a simple vertically scrolling game.

We planned the basic mechanics of the game on whiteboards and determined what programming paradigms were required to make it work. While Rebekka worked on the art for the game, and Seori focused on music, the rest of the team broke the project down into components and layers before merging it all together in the final hours of the jam.
